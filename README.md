# File Structure

ESvalues/ - **src** / Source code files (.R .Rmd, etc) - **data** / RAW Data files (not processed data) - **out** / Output from analyses (including processed data files and figures)

# Note w K

-   how do we change peoples values based on targeting communities

-   Are the people who go to the workshops more dedicated/comitted/aware of problem/value ES higher?

    -   controlled for income

-   How important is community cohesion? Does sharing similar collective values

-   99 people agreed 30-50 participated

# To Do:

1.  Alpha Count
2.  Watch on double speed:
    1.  intreraction effects
    2.  AICs
    3.  DAGs
    4.  If needed
        1.  GLM
3.  Analysis considering ...
    1.  interaction effects

1.  Final Initial Viz
    1.  combine parameters if desire but not too much time

1.  ~~Read feedback from Cooper.~~

2.  Look up

3.  Literature Review

    -   What questions are asked by studies that use surveys to understand Ecosystem Service (ES) values?
    -   What statistical tests are most commonly used for Likert responses in these surveys?
    -   What unique contribution can I make with this research?

4.  Compare these two methods

    1.  Ordered Categorical Response

    2.  Factor Analysis

        1.  Really common w likert

5.  Initial Data Exploration

    -   Summary Stats
        -   What are the distributions of:
            -   Demographics
                -   Gender
                -   Birth Year
                -   Race
                -   Years in Community
                -   Politics
                -   Adults in Home
                -   Children in Home
                -   Fraction of household members that are children
                -   Income
                -   Education
            -   Perception of Environmental Quality
            -   Values
                -   Mean score for each ES
                -   Mean score for each respondent\
            -   Actions Taken
                -   Mean frequency for each action
                -   Mean frequency for each respondent\
            -   Likert Statements
                -   Mean score for each statement\
                -   Mean score for each respondent
                    -   are there people who are overall more pessimistic/optimistic than the others?
                    -   or are the values of each participant generally distributed the same?
                    -   how about for each gender/race/income bracket/education level?

6.  Establish Questions

7.  Fit Models

8.  Evaluate the Assumptions and Compare Models

9.  Visualize the Results of Model

10. Draw Conclusions

# Notes from before:

## Limitations

-   Survey is not structured specifically to be relevant to my research questions?

-   Predictors

-   Birth Month

    -   allergins at times of year

    -   cultural norms associated with zodiac signs

    -   psycological impacts on child development depending on seasonality

-   Gender

-   Education

-   Effective Ways to think about a complex topic

    -   Hearing someone talk about it

    -   Social Influence

-   **Political** - does it play a role

-   

    -   i will not have kids bc of the future of the planet

    -   I have kids and want them to thrive
