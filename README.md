# File Structure

ESvalues/
- **src** /               Source code files (.R .Rmd, etc)
- **data** /              RAW Data files (not processed data)
- **out** /               Output from analyses (including processed data files and figures)


# To Do:

1. Read feedback from Cooper.

1. Literature Review
    - What questions are asked by studies that use surveys to understand Ecosystem Service (ES) values?
   - What statistical tests are most commonly used for Likert responses in these surveys?
   - What unique contribution can I make with this research?

1. Initial Data Exploration
    - Summary Stats
      - What are the distributions of:
        - Demographics
          - Gender
          - Birth Year
          - Race
          - Years in Community
          - Politics
          - Adults in Home
          - Children in Home
          - Fraction of household members that are children
          - Income
          - Education
        - Perception of Environmental Quality
        - Values
          - Mean score for each ES
          - Mean score for each respondent  
        - Actions Taken
          - Mean frequency for each action
          - Mean frequency for each respondent   
        - Likert Statements
          - Mean score for each statement     
          - Mean score for each respondent
            - are there people who are overall more pessimistic/optimistic than the others?
            - or are the values of each participant generally distributed the same?
            - how about for each gender/race/income bracket/education level?

1. Establish Questions
   
1. Fit Models

1. Evaluate the Assumptions and Compare Models

1. Visualize the Results of Model

1. Draw Conclusions
